# Generator for Phoenix templates which use TailwindCSS

Currently I am working on the problem how to build this package. 
See:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65591612/location-for-a-phoenix-helper-in-a-hex-package

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `tailwind_phx_generators` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:tailwind_phx_generators, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/tailwind_phx_generators](https://hexdocs.pm/tailwind_phx_generators).
